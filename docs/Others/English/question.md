3.Could you introduce your undergraduate university?
My university is very beautiful. It is an old school in Luoyang. The learning atmosphere in the library is very strong . There are many excellent teachers. And they are very responsible. I had learned a lot of knowledge there. so I love my university very much.
   
4.Can you describe your favorite book? 
I have read many kinds of books ,among them I found “ the old man and the sea ” by hemingway the most encouraging . This book tells a story of an old man fighting against a gigantic fish. I was deeply impressed by the old man's persistence on not giving up and his strong will to face against bad luck . From the book, I have learned success only belongs to those who are persistent and patient. Never say no to failure. 
（The influence has still worked on me although I read the book 10 years ago.）

5.How to explain your ability of self-learning?
Firstly , When I am studying , I will concentrate my attention on it . The sounds around can hardly bother me . Secondly , when I will complete a task, I will plan it first, and then work it according to the plan . thirdly , I pay attention to sum up my learning methods to improve learning efficiency . So I think my learning efficiency is higher than others, and my self-learning ability is strong . 
   
6.How do you demonstrate you are optimistic?
I believe the world is magic and full of surprises . Life is full of sweets and bitters. Maybe sometimes you are sad because of some difficulties, but most of time you are happy . If you live your life by heart ,you will find that life is wonderful . I always cherish this kind of blessing and live every day to its fullest.

7.How do you demonstrate you are persistent?
I think One has to work hard and persist to the end. When you look around, you can find competition is everywhere. People are struggling for their life and work. If you are lazy, you will definitely be left behind .
（ optimism makes me smile. And persistence keeps me work. I am always like this work while smiling ）

8.How do you usually deal with the difficulty in life?
Actually , life has never been easy .I always have a lot of difficulty in study and life. For example , some specialized courses is very difficult like data structure .I always forget the idea of sort algorithm . But I never lose my confidence to overcome it. I believe Practice makes perfect .So I recited them over and over again . finally , I make it .

9.Who is you favorite your teacher and why?
My favorite teacher is Mr. Zhang . He is my Operating System teacher . He is very patient during the class. Sometimes we don’t understand what he said, he never criticized us for that . Instead , he explained to us again and again until we all understood.

10.How do you arrange your day during the preparation for the graduate school admission test? 
     Every morning , I get up at 6 o'clock . After 30 minutes , I go to the library for study. Sometimes , I'm not awake , I will drink a cup of coffee to make myself awake.I almost stay in the library for at least 12 hours every day . I have to say it is one of the hardest periods in my life . But ,thanks to it ,I realized study gives people confidence, strength and happiness.

11.What do you think is your best quality and worst quality?
My best quality is that I'm able to work hard. I may not be the best, but I always try my best. I still remember the time when I prepared for the graduate school admission test. I got up early and went to bed late. I kept on learning from dawn to dusk. I cut off the contact with my friends, which could help me concentrate . Eventually , my efforts have paid off .

14.What is your plan in the postgraduate study? /How do you plan to study for your graduate program?
First, I will try my best to learn the theoretical knowledge and make a foundation for my further study. Second, if time permits, I will find some practice which is related to computer so that I can put the theory into practice. Third, I will participate in some competitions and activities to broaden knowledge.
