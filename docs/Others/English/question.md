附加：
1.What does friendship mean to you and what kind of people do you make friend with?

(遇到困难时，第一时间送上心灵的慰藉的人；我喜欢和性格开朗的人交朋友)
When you are in trouble, send comfort in the first place; I like to make friends with optimistic people
























由前述复试经历，可总结几点如下：

1，老师打断较多，且不知道什么时候会打断，所以问题的要点一定要在前面说处理来，如还未打断再逐条解释各个要点；

2，个人政治陈述和英文自我介绍最好能控制在1分钟之内，不然打断风险极高，开个头迅速进入个人亮点部分；

2，回答还是力求直接切入正题。我复试时废话比较多。可能是工作中经常给领导汇报而养成的习惯，回答问题喜欢先铺设背景、达成双方共识。在复试中，就没有这个必要，老师问什么，就直接了当切入问题点而回答，因为老师都是领域专家，双方已经有基础共识了。老师问这个，考生回答半天别的，就容易被认为知识不够或耍滑头。

3，复试也考验运气。我运气偏好，复试时抽到的题都不难，唯一的难题就是银行家算法。后来我看了看那个算法，要真搞清楚这个算法还是需要花费一些时间的。

4，非全在专业课上，编译原理不要碰；其它科目，找一找总结性的笔记，看看概念即可。非全要工作，就须讲究复试效率，看看概念，不至于冷场，就能过。不同于非全，全日制还是需要做好万全准备。



Well, this is a really difficulty problem，so please allow me to think about it.
