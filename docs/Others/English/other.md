### 介绍一本书
when i read <One Hundred Years of Solitude>, i am so impressed with the novel that i have read it for 3 times. it tells a story of a family of seven generations. i feel dark and dusty with no sunshine when i attracted by it. everything in it seems to be unnormal but real.it give me differnent experience when compraring other novels.


I have read many kinds of books ,among them I found “ the old man and the sea ” by hemingway the most encouraging . This book tells a story of an old man fighting against a gigantic fish. I was deeply impressed by the old man's persistence on not giving up and his strong will to face against bad luck . From the book, I have learned success only belongs to those who are persistent and patient. Never say no to failure. 
（The influence has still worked on me although I read the book 10 years ago.）
